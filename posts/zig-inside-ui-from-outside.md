# Zig Inside, UI from Outside

A new terminal app called Ghostty (Mac version) was developed using Zig and SwiftUI. As far as I know, this is only the second practical app using Zig. It's interesting how it supports a native platform experience like SwiftUI, while the Linux version uses Tk.

After learning about this, I was inspired to develop a Markdown app using a similar technology stack, such as Zig and Flutter.
