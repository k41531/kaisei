# The Eternal Struggle: Choosing Color Schemes

I'm planning a redesign of my site, and one thing I always struggle with when writing code is deciding on a color scheme. Sometimes, I choose a palette from Coolors.co, but I really want a standard color scheme of my own. Personally, I like Dracula and Nord and often use them, but the contrarian in me resists using colors that are so popular.

I realize thereâ€™s only one solution: creating an original color scheme. The question is, what theme should I base it on?
