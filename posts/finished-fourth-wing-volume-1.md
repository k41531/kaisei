# Finished Fourth Wing Volume 1

I finished reading the first volume of Fourth Wing. I’ve mentioned this book a few times on my blog — it was really interesting.

It felt like an Americanized version of Harry Potter.

I’ll continue reading the second volume. Also, I’ve achieved one of my goals for this month: reading a book! Now I just need to watch a movie to fully complete my monthly goal.
