Claude 3.7 Sonnet has been released. I wondered where Claude 3.5 Opus was, but I heard that the next Claude Frontier Model is 3.7 Sonnet instead.

When I use AI for coding, I have been selecting Claude 3.5 since OpenAI's O series was released because I feel Claude is better for coding.

Since the model is already available on Copilot, Iâ€™m looking forward to using it.
