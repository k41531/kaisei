## Introduce
I'm interested in this paper and want to detail reading, so I write split note.

## Abstract
Firstly this paper describe about the dark web overview.
The survey focused extensively review and classification attack in the dark web.
Furthermore provide detailed overview about existing threat detection technique and limitations.


## Introduction
### History
- What most people think of as the web is 4% of whole web and called "Surface web".
- Remains 96% is "Deep Web", especially illegally purpose used part is called "Dark Web".
- 57% of activity is illegal (Data breach, drag, porn, human-trafficking) by litelature.
- The benefit by cyber crime is $1.5 trillion in 2018.
- Dark Web has been existing when started internet in 1960s, it had become household-term in 1990s.
- Most people unaware Dark Web until 2013, when Silk Road operator  Ross William Ulbricht (alias D. P. Roberts) imprisoned .

### Dark Web overview 
- The dark web is not indexed by search engines.
- The dark web has both public and private aspects.
	- Anyone can access if installed appropriate software.
	- Dark web is mostly encrypted, so privacy is protected and activity is untraceable.
- Anonymity tools
	- Tor, FreeNet, Subgraph O.S and Invisible internet project I2P.
	- Tor brouser is the most robust unidentified communication tool among Tor, Riffle, I2P, and Whoinx.

### Aims
- To see different aspects of the three most popular dark web systems: Tor, I2P and FreeNet.
- To access the current state, usage and growth of the dark web.
- To describe the dark web‚Äôs anonymity, its weak points, and how various cyberattacks can breach this anonymity.
- To survey threat intelligence techniques, their efficiency, and limitations in attack detection and generation of adequate response.

### Contributions
- An extensive analysis of the dark web threat intelligence literature.
- A comparative study of the existing anonymity tools with their pros and cons.
- A a novel and detailed threat taxonomy for the Tor network.
- A discussion on existing counterattacks is also included.
- Outlined future research directions
