# First Impressions of Claude Code

Today was my first time trying Claude Code. I've been using GitHub Copilot and Cursor, but since Claude Code has been trending lately, I decided to give it a shot.

At first, I couldn’t fully appreciate its potential like some well-known engineers can. I think the reason is that I’m not a high-level engineer. Those on the front lines are able to unlock the full power of AI, but I’m still learning how to get the most out of it.

That said, I really liked the CLI interface. Compared to GUI tools like VSCode or Cursor, it helped me get into a better flow state. I’m not very skilled with Vim yet, but I still felt the benefits of working in the terminal.

Also, I found Claude inside Claude Code easier to work with than Claude on other platforms. It still requires good prompt and rule design, but I like this Claude a lot.

Right now, my code review skills for AI-generated code are lacking, so it takes me a while to review everything. I want to improve my review skills as much as possible this month, especially when working with AI.
