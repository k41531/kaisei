# Stable Diffusion Is Still Hard to Master

I used Stable Diffusion XL for the first time. I thought image generation with AI is still difficult.

I also felt this way when I used Stable Diffusion in the past. It doesn’t generate high-quality images if you just use it without proper techniques.

I will use ImageFX because I don’t have time to master Stable Diffusion.
