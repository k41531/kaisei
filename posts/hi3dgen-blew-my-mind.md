# Hi3DGen Blew My Mind

Hi3DGen is INSANE! I had never tried 3D model generative AI before because its quality didn’t attract me. But today, I saw a tweet showcasing a high-quality 3D model, and it caught my attention.

I found that I could try it on Hugging Face, so I did—and I was truly surprised! I provided an AI-generated chess piece image, and Hi3DGen gave me a perfect 3D model.

The code hasn’t been published yet, but the README says “Code will be released by April 10th. Stay tuned.” I'm looking forward to it.
