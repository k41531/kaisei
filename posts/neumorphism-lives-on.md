# Neumorphism Lives On

I've been interested in Neumorphism for a long time. According to Google Trends, it spiked in popularity around 2020, and I think that's when I first learned about it. Web UI design trends have evolved over the years, transitioning from Skeuomorphism to Flat Design and then to Material Design. I thought Neumorphism might be the next big trend, but it hasn’t gained widespread adoption yet. It’s hard to pinpoint the current design trend in one word, but personally, I think it involves maintaining the simplicity and material textures of Material Design while incorporating soft gradients and focusing on user experience through interactive animations.

At the end of last year, I was surprised to see that the Pokémon TCG app used Neumorphism in its design. Its UI/UX is excellent and reminded me a bit of the Pokémon Center. The card pack opening feature in particular is designed to closely resemble real-life interactions, which made me think Neumorphism was chosen as a bridge between the digital and physical experiences. If there’s an interview or article about the design process, I’d love to read it.
