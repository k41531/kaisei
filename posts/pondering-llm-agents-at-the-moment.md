# Pondering LLM Agents at the Moment

The first AI trend of 2025 seems to be "Agents," as predicted last year. Many companies have released services powered by LLM-based agents, and early adopters are sharing information about them on social media. I tried an agent-powered VS Code extension called Cline, and it was indeed impressive, though I still can't fully rely on it to autonomously develop something.

I'm also intrigued by Devin, a so-called "completely autonomous agent", but what I really want is an AI that can seamlessly integrate with Obsidian to support my PKM (personal knowledge management). As Anthropic’s post mentions, simple solutions are often better, so I agree that not everything needs to be turned into an agent. That said, I’d like to gradually build an agent that feels like a clone of myself—someone (or something) I can truly rely on.
