# Playing Sultan’s Game

Recently, I’ve been playing a game called Sultan's Game. It’s a card-based simulation game, but it’s not just about resource management — it focuses heavily on the story. It’s my first time playing this type of game, and I find it really interesting. The only downside is that it takes a lot of time, but I’ll just play it slowly.
