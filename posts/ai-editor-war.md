# AI Editor War

I'm currently using VSCode and GitHub Copilot. Recently, AI editors have been a hot topic on X, so I thought I’d take some time to reevaluate which one might be the best.

The only AI development support tool I was familiar with before was Cursor. When I used Cursor, I was impressed by its "Composer" feature, which automatically generates files. However, GitHub Copilot now offers a similar feature called "Copilot Edit," so I’m not sure what the real differences are between them.

On the other hand, there are other tools like Cline and Cody, both available as VSCode extensions. Cline recommends using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and its README mentions advanced features like "Computer Use" and "Model Context Protocol," suggesting it’s a versatile tool. Cody seems similar to Cline, and I’ve read personal blog posts praising its cost-effectiveness. However, I can’t really tell how they differ. On X, I noticed that some people use both, which implies there are functional differences between them.

In any case, it seems like it’s hard to fully grasp their differences without heavy usage. That said, if you’re willing to pay, GitHub Copilot, at $100 per year, seems like the most practical option to me.
