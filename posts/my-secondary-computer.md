Now, I am mainly using my laptop temporarily because I haven't been at my house for the past month. I bought it when I was a university student. It originally ran Windows, but I deleted it and installed Arch Linux (though now it's running NixOS). My main computer is a Mac Mini, so I don't use the laptop much, but it's useful in situations like this.
