# Experimenting with Word Memory Methods

Memorizing words with images was not bad. I experimented for 50 days using only words, and another 50 days using words with images. The effect wasn’t as good as I expected, but I think it had some positive impact. In the next phase, I’m going to try using words, images, and phrases together.
