I donâ€™t have a high-performance PC, such as one with an RTX 4090. I have an M1 Max, a mini PC, and a ThinkPad from a few generations ago, so I often worry when I want to run generative AI.

My current solution is to use Modal, a GPU infrastructure service similar to RunPod. The price is not cheaper than other services, but it gives me 30 credits every month. It is useful for a light user like me.
