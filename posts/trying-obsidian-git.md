# Trying Obsidian Git 

Obsidian's Git plugin is great. I had known about it before, but I didn't use it because I was using Obsidian Sync and thought they might conflict. However, that was a misunderstanding.

Recently, I've been organizing my notes using a script, so I need a backup. When I looked into how to back them up, the Obsidian documentation recommended using the Obsidian Git plugin. Furthermore, the plugin's documentation explains how to use it with Obsidian Sync.

It's very useful, and I should have used it sooner.
