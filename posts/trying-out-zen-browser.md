# Trying Out Zen Browser

I'm trying to switch my main browser from Arc Browser to Zen Browser.

Arc provided the best browsing experience I’ve ever had, but recently, it has added many features I don’t need, so the overall experience feels worse. Furthermore, a serious vulnerability was discovered before.

While looking for an alternative, I found a similar browser called Zen. It looks like Arc but is based on Firefox and open source (whereas Arc is Chromium-based).

My first impression is that the UI is useful because it’s similar to Arc, but it’s not stable—especially the sidebar, which seems buggy. It has some issues, but it’s still usable, so I’ll keep using it for a while and hope it improves.
