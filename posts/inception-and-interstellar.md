# Inception and Interstellar

I watched _Inception_ and _Interstellar_. I like the story of _Inception_ more than  _Interstellar_, but I prefer the world setting of _Interstellar_.

Some other SF movies I've watched in the past are _Blade Runner_ and _2001: A Space Odyssey_. I like _Blade Runner_, and I also read _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, which was my first SF novel.

As for _2001: A Space Odyssey_, I couldn't understand it, but I  realized that the movie's technology is amazing.
