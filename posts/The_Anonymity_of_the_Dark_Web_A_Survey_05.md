# The Anonymity of the Dark Web: A Survey #05

This is my personal note about the paper introduction.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359421382_The_Anonymity_of_the_Dark_Web_A_Survey

This note is writing about overview of section 3 (THREAT INTELLIGENCE
TECHNIQUES) on this paper.

## Threat intelligence techniques

**The architectural framework analysis process**

- Data Gathering
  - Describe the data sources, the data collection size, the data set's
    availabitily
- Data pre-processing
  - filtering, extractions, duplication or noise reduction
- Data processing
  - machine learning, data classification such as clustering or labelling,
    testing data
- Result`

### Dark web forums monitoring

In this section present various security strategies by different cyber security
researchers and scientists.

- Marin systematically report
  - Mainly reveals three altered methods
    - content, social network, and seniority-based analysis
- Deliu designed an automatic hybrid cyberthreat intelligence.
  - Support Vector Machine and latent Dirichlet allocation
- L'Huillier addressed the community key member.
  - Combining text mining and proposed social network analysis techniques.
- Yang et al. developed.
  - Visualize system for dark web forum system and relationsip between various
    forum messages and posters.
- Kadoguchi et al. created.
  - A dataset using sixgill's web crawler tool.
- Schafer et al. disscused.
  - The architecutre of the Black-window for the early detection of
    cyberthreats.
- Alnablsi and Islam proposed.
  - A methodology to evaluate relationships between dark web forums.
- Sarkar designed
  - A framework of attack prediction in the real-time point.

### Marketplace's surveillance

- Dong designed
  - A framework to detect cyberthreats through text mining techniques in dark
    web marketplaces.
- Cherqi et al. performed
  - An experimental study about illegal trade.
- Nunes et al. designed
  - A system that influences threat intelligence and makes a detection based on
    at-risk systems.

### Monitoring of dark websites

- Alkhatib and Basheer monitoring
  - by Scrapy1, known as Darky
- Ferry et al. monitoring
  - by a regular dark web scan by monitoring policy
- Alyze
- Hadoop-based framework
- Wang et al. suggested
  - A method to obtain personal attributes by implementing three steps.

### Traffic monitoring in the dark web

- Darknet traffic
  - Botnets, Spoofing, DDoS attacks, probes, scanning attacks

1. Detection of tor related traffic
   - Cuzzocrea et al. describe a procedure using a machine learning technique
     and a basic rule of analyzing.
     - using Wireshark and the tcpdump tool
1. Detection of malware
   - Han te al. proposed
     - The real-time detection of malware activities using online processing of
       the Glasso engine by analyzing dark web traffic.
1. Detection of malign traffic
   - Kumar et al. proposed
     - A threat detection method by monitoring dark web traffic using machine
       learning classifier
1. Darknet visibility
   1. Soro et al. deployed
      1. Three different darknets composed of IPv4 adresses in Brazil, the
         Netherlands, and Italy to identify darknet visibility facts.

### Through Honeypot

#### Low Interaction

- A partial range of communication with the external system.
- The major determination of this type is to detect delimited linking efforts

#### Medium Interaction

- A semi-virtual honeypot
- better-quality model services than low interaction honeypot

#### High Interaction

- The most advanced type of honeypot.
- The efficiency is in realistic approaches to the attackers and folds more
  information related to envisioned attacks

#### Researches

- Zeid et al. excuted
  - Two honeypots with three automated secure virtual machines on the dark
    - First, a research honeypot which is a chatroom web server.
    - Second, a production honeypot which provides hacking service and is
      maintained on a vulnerable virtual maxhine.
- Catakoglu et al. applied
  - A high interaction honeypot, consisting of three types of web-based and
    system-based honeypot.
    1. A website concealed as a private drug marketplace that trade to close
       group of summoned followers.
    2. A blog web page that promotes modified Internet results for hosting in
       the Tor network.
    3. A convention private setting that only allows privileged persons to log
       in.
  - These honeypots' values show that assaults from the Surface Web effectively
    undermined the principal clone.
