# Kicking Off 2025 with Tech

## Pick up Five Hardware

I've purchased several Nothing products. They're reasonably priced, so I plan to
continue following their releases.

### M1 Mac mini

I bought the M1 Mac mini in 2020, and it still performs well today. I want to
buy M4 but I don't have any reason for buying.

### Nothing Phone (2a)

When buying a new smartphone, I was torn between the Pixel and Nothing. The
design Nothing is better for me so I select. In the result my selection was
good.

### Nothing Ear (a)

Yellow model is cute like "Bunblebee"!

### CMF Watch Pro2

This is my first smart watch which does not have a lot of feature instead of
cheep price.

### Shokz OpenMove

My first bone-conduction earphones. This is the cheapest model but not bad.

## Pick up Five Software

Besides these picks, I'm also interested in exploring other tools like Nix, AI
applications, and Neovim.

### Obsidian

Essential software. I'm writing this post on this. I want to be able to use it
more.

### Raycast

Essential software for me on Mac. This app support my productivity.

### Arc

I think this is the most useful browser for me ever but recently I've started to
notice minor behaviors that bother me, so I might switch to a different browser.

### 1Password

I changed from NordPass. I has heard anywhere this app. Being one of the most
famous password managers, it is very user-friendly.

### Ghostty

This terminal app was released on December 26, 2024. I had been using Alacritty
and I liked this but I decide to to try it after hearing good things about it.
Along with that I'm thinking of stopping my use of tmux as well.
