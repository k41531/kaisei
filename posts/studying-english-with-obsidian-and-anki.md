# Studying English with Obsidian and Anki
I created a new Obsidian vault to study English. There are three types of notes: words, phrases, and knowledge.

I have been studying English using Anki. Whenever I read an article and find a word I don’t know, I add it to Anki.

Today, I thought I wanted to study English more like knowledge management, so I created a vault and integrated Anki using AnkiConnect.

I don’t know if this method is effective for studying English, but I’m going to experiment with different approaches.
