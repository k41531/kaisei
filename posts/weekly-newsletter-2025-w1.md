# Weekly Newsletter 2025-W1

I’ll share the news and technology that caught my interest this week.

## Tech

### CLIP-as-serivce

CLIP is an embedding model that computes similarities between images and text.
It is widely used in diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion. CLIP-as-service
by Jina AI makes it easy to integrate CLIP into your service. I became
interested in this because one of my favorite engineers,
[Kat](https://x.com/poetengineer__) posted about it on X (formerly Twitter).

### Cline and Cody

Cline and Cody are available as VSCode extensions. If you don't want to spend
much money, using these might help save on AI subscriptions. I’m not sure about
their advantages because I haven’t tried them yet, so I need to give them a
shot. However, I think if you can afford it, GitHub Copilot or Cursor might be
better choices.

### DOOM CAPTCHA

It's too difficult... I think AI might be better than humans at playing.
