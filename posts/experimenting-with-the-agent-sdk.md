# Experimenting with the Agent SDK

The Agent SDK is difficult but interesting.

I granted permission from the application to the agent—it’s a small thing, but it felt great!

I’m trying voice communication using the Agent SDK sample, but it’s not very comfortable, so I’m researching how to improve it.
