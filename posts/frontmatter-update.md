# Frontmatter Update

Today, I updated the frontmatter of my personal knowledge notes. The format was not standardized, so Iâ€™m working on it now.

There are five properties: title, alias, tags, created, and version. I think version is not a common property, but I use it to manage the note format because my note-taking style keeps evolving, just like this frontmatter update.

I made Copilot Edit write a script to update it, and it was useful since I could run it on o3-mini.
