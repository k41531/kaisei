# Enhancing Vocabulary with AI and Obsidian

I tried to create an AI-powered workflow for memorizing words.

First, I collect unknown words. Second, I send two prompts to ChatGPT: one asks it to generate a short sentence that helps remind me of the word, and the other asks it to create an image generation prompt based on that sentence.

Lastly, I use the generated prompt to order an image from an image generation model—I’m using ImageFX. The created images and words are managed in Obsidian.

I think this method looks promising; it may help improve memory efficiency. However, one task remains: it hasn't been automated yet.
