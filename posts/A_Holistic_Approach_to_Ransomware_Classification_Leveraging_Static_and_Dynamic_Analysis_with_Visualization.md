# A Holistic Approach to Ransomware Classification: Leveraging Static and Dynamic Analysis with Visualization

This is my personal note about the paper. https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/15/1/46

## Abstract

This paper suggests a holistic approach to ransomware classification by static
analysis, dynamic analysis and visualization techniques.

- **Static analysis**: fast and accurate
- **Dynamic analysis**: able to classify and cluster packed ransomware samples.
- **Visualization**: able to classify and cluster large datasets of ransomware
  in a more intuitive and effective way.

## Contributions

1. Comparative analysis of infection behaviors across various ransomware
   families.
2. Utilization of data visualization methods for the identification of similar
   ransomware samples within extensive datasets.
3. Employing a similarity matrix approach for the analysis of static and dynamic
   features in ransomware samples.
4. Assessment of the merits and limitations associated with static and dynamic
   feature analysis.
5. Comprehensive survey and comparative evaluation of varied ransomware
   detection approaches, alongside an in-depth exploration of the ransomware
   detection ecosystem.
6. Development and proposal of an automated methodology for extracting diverse
   feature sets from ransomware samples.

## Categories

- **Encrypting Ransomware**: This category involves ransomware that encrypts
  files on the victim’s system, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is
  paid.
- **Locker Ransomware**: Locker ransomware locks the victim out of their entire
  system, preventing access until a ransom is provided.
- **Doxware or Leakware**: This type threatens to release sensitive information
  unless a ransom is paid, often compromising privacy.
- **Scareware**: Scareware displays false warnings or claims of malware
  infections, extorting money for their removal.
- **Mobile Ransomware**: Designed for mobile devices, this category targets
  smartphones and tablets, encrypting data or locking the device.
- **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)**: RaaS platforms allow cybercriminals to
  easily create and distribute ransomware, contributing to its proliferation.
- **Targeted Ransomware**: Some ransomware attacks are highly targeted, focusing
  on specific organizations or individuals, often with higher ransom demands.
- **Cryptojacking**: While it is not traditional ransomware, cryptojacking
  malware hijacks computer resources to mine cryptocurrencies, often without the
  victim’s consent.

## Interesting points

- A brief history of ransomware is presented.
- It is clear that there are several patterns in the behavior of ransomware.

## Thoughts

The paper looked like a good overview of ransomware categories.
