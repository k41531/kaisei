# Organizing Second Brain

I'm organizing my second brain. It consists of Markdown files created with Obsidian.

I was inspired by the Zettelkasten method for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), which I learned about five years ago. When I started PKM, I didn’t know how to manage it, so my note-taking style has changed a lot.

Now, I still don’t know the best way to manage it, but it’s becoming more structured. So, I’m organizing and aligning both new and old notes.
