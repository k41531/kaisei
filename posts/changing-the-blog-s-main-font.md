# Changing the Blog's Main Font

I changed the main font on this site. The only paid font I own is Berkley Mono, but it is a monospace font designed for coding. Since I think serif fonts are the best choice for blogs, I investigated what font Medium uses. Medium uses Source Serif Pro, which was created by an Adobe designer. Fortunately, Google Fonts provides a similar font by the same designer called Source Serif 4, so I decided to use it.

Additionally, since Source Serif 4 is a variable font, I created a [playground page](https://kaisei.dev/playgrounds/variable-font) to experiment with it. One of the variation axes in this font is Optical Size. While the concept of Optical Size has existed in the printing world for a long time, it only became available on the web with the introduction of variable fonts in 2016. When Optical Sizing is enabled, the fontâ€™s characteristics remain consistent even as the font size changes, which I find both interesting and effective.
