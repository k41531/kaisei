# Refining My Priorities
My focus is scattered right now—AI, Knowledge Management, App Development, Writing, Design, and English.

I need to accept that I can’t do everything, especially since I started a new life with little ones this year. So, I must focus on one thing.

Although it’s a bit late, I’ve decided on my goal for this year: to improve my English skills until they feel like my native language, especially in reading and listening. I want to be able to read English articles easily and listen to podcasts comfortably.
