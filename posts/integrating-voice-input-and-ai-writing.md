# Integrating Voice Input and AI Writing

I want to integrate voice input, a text editor, and an LLM. There is no such application available right now, so if I want it, I’ll have to build it myself—but I’m not sure if I can. Anyway, I need to try MCP first. I recently learned about mcp.run, which was developed by an Extism developer, so I’m going to give it a try.
