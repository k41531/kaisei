# Partially Automating My Word Learning Workflow

I partially automated the workflow I posted yesterday.

At first, I tried to use Dify, but Docker threw an error, so I had Copilot generate a script instead.

As a result, it automatically generates example sentences and prompts for image generation that help remind me of a word. It works fine, but Iâ€™m still refining this workflow.
