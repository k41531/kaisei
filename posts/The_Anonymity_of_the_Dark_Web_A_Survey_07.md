# The Anonymity of the Dark Web: A Survey #07

This is my personal note about the paper introduction.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359421382_The_Anonymity_of_the_Dark_Web_A_Survey

This is the last note about this paper.

## Research gaps and future works

### Cybercrimes

1. How and with what ratio the dark web crimes and growth in the crypto market
   are correlated?
2. How critical is the dark web to the success of coordinated strikes

### Distributed Hidden Services

1. What is the trend towards more decentralized existing web infrastructure,
   mainly hidden services?
2. What and how do technologial factors affect Dark Web scalability and
   observability?
3. What plan of action can law enforcement agencies use to exercise Dark Web
   control? Is it worth it focusing on users, severs, or the protocol, e.g., Tor
   itself?

### Threat Detection

1. What are the real-time threat detection techniques to prevent crimes?
2. What patterns can be discerned from the dark web's current hidden service?
3. How can we incorporate artificial intelligence as an automatic reply tool to
   the forums and marketplaces to monitor and detect a threat?

### De-Anonymization

1. To what extent attacks on Tor can be crucial or successful to the anonymity
   of its users.
2. What is the effectiveness of denial of service attacks in Tor, I2P, Freenet,
   etc. ?
3. How efficient is the traceback attack on the I2P network?
4. Investigate the comparison of traffic attacks on the anonymity-providing
   tools.

## Conclusion

This paper discussed different browsers of the darkweb structures,
vulnerabilities and attacks pattern, and sort up mitigation techniques.
Furthermore comparison of different cyber intelligence techniques. In the future
work, need to study about uncovering crime, relative real crime and relative
crypto market.

## Thoughts

This paper categoriesed and describe easy to understand dark web overview. I
could read a little more than other papers. Although I gave up for this amount
to read so the later harf posts l cut coners. I should reread this and I will
when I am reading others.
