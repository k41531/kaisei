# Conversational Speech AI That Feels Real

The conversational speech generation technology that Sesame reported on is brilliant. The quality of the voice is far ahead of existing voice generation technology.

I tried the demo on the web, and it is truly conversationalâ€”it made me want to talk more.

Right now, this voice generation technology is only available as a demo, but if the service is released, I may subscribe to it.
