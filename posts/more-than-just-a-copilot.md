# More Than Just a Copilot

Today, I developed an app without writing any code myself, using only Copilot Agent. I think it's not just a Copilot—it was the Pilot.

When I first tried it, I attempted to create an Anki clone. It developed the app using Node.js, but the result wasn’t great because the project had too many files—this is the fate of web tech stacks.

This time, I made Copilot develop an auto-transcribing audio player using Python, and it was successful. The app is practical for me.

I really didn’t write any code. The agent feature is currently available only in the Insiders version of VS Code. I'm looking forward to the official release.
