# MCP Is Becoming the De Facto AI Standard

Iâ€™m convinced that MCP is going to become the de facto standard for the AI ecosystem. When OpenAI released the Agent SDK, I wondered how they would approach MCP, but they have finally decided to support it. Additionally, the Responses API will also be supported. I need to experiment with it a lot.
